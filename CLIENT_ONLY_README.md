# LinkLinkup - Client-Only Version

This is a client-only version of the LinkLinkup application, configured to work without any server-side code. All API functionality has been replaced with direct database connections using Supabase.

## Important Notes

1. **Security Warning**: This approach uses a direct database connection from the client side, which is not recommended for production applications with sensitive data. The Supabase anonymous key is exposed in the client code.

2. **Functionality**: All functionality is implemented on the client side, including:
   - User profile data
   - Social links
   - All datasets (singles, albums, blog posts, etc.)
   - Courses
   - Analytics

## Setup Instructions

1. **Remove Server Files**:
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x client-setup.sh
   
   # Run the setup script
   ./client-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   The built files will be in the `public` directory. Deploy this directory to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

## How It Works

1. **Database Connection**: The application connects directly to Supabase using the client SDK in `client/src/services/databaseService.js`.

2. **API Interception**: All API calls are intercepted in `client/src/services/apiClient.js` and routed to the appropriate database service method.

3. **Fallback Data**: If database connections fail, fallback mock data is provided to ensure the application doesn't break.

## Testing

Before deploying, test all functionality to ensure data is being properly fetched from the database:
- Open the browser console to check for any errors or warnings
- Verify each dataset is loading correctly
- Test the courses functionality specifically, which was previously having issues

## Future Improvements

For a more secure implementation in the future, consider:
1. Setting up a proper backend API service
2. Using environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Implementing proper authentication and authorization
